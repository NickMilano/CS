Overall the server and client work together as described.
When the server starts it will create a socket including a random port
and this port will be written to stdout.
The server will not close until it recieves SIGINT.
The client should easily pair with the server as long as
the correct arguments are passed. Can connect as many clients as wanted.
For testing there was a case that I found issues with, if the client runs
ls as a lone command with no args (usually this should work) however if other
clients have had created files or directories on the server it will not work
however running ls . will work, I tested making directories and files from the client
and that seems to work fine.
On compilation there were some warnings from the original code but it just had to do
with the types in some of the calls.
